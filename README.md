# MyCarbon
## Repository for the upcoming project MyCarbon, a carbon footprint measurement, object-oriented app.
### Designed and developed by second-year students from the National University of Science and Technology "Politehnica" of Bucharest, Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science - System Engineering (Automatic Control) field.

### UPDATE 1 - NOVEMBER 1, 2024
- GitHub repository created.
- First brainstorming session held.
- Each member now has a specific role in the project:
  * Radu-Andrei Cîrcioroabă: Data processing and calculation collaborator (responsible for developing mathematical models to estimate the carbon footprint efficiently, based on three categories: individual carbon footprint, diet/eating habits, and housing/residence) & layout designer.
  * Andrei-Valentin Bălălău & Ionuț-Cristian Pleșeanu: Graphic User Interface contributors (responsible for implementing graphic elements, using designs from our layout designer and features like adaptive video resolution, responsive design, and functional buttons) & integration developers (connecting visual elements with backend functionalities).
  * Ștefăniță Lican & Eduard Șipanu: Core developers, monitoring overall performance and implementing core features in C++ (main functionalities of a simplified carbon measurement app, including object-oriented operations with classes and various linking methods).
- The entire app will be developed in C++ (covering both design and coding functionalities).

  
### UPDATE 2 - NOVEMBER 7, 2024
- Submitted the first bi-weekly project development report.
- Completed the first stage of design development (layout of the main menu and related functionalities) (1/3 - Design).
- Currently working on setting up parameters for carbon footprint calculations and implementing object/class structures (0.5/3 - Functionalities).
- No performance optimization has been done yet (as coding is still incomplete) (0/3 - Efficiency & Performance)
- Second major brainstorming session for core development is coming soon.
