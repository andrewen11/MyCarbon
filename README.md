Ready for deployment with no critical issues.
Project successfully concluded and ready for public release!

### UPDATE 9 - JANUARY 15, 2025 | DEMO VERSION
- UI elements refined for clarity and functionality, with layout adjustments finalized.
- Final UI polishing underway, especially for settings menu.
- App runs smoothly under all tested scenarios, including large datasets.
- Home page updates: new country selection mode available (depending on the selected country, the given emission factors may be different)
#### {!!!} FEEDBACK - 16th January 2025 | DEMO VERSION

### UPDATE 8 - DECEMBER 21, 2025
- Full system testing began as planned, with smooth handling of general and most exceptional cases.
- Performance bottlenecks discovered during housing-related carbon footprint calculations, optimization ongoing.
- Data synchronization across modules almost completed (90%).
- Diet page rebuild: the calculation system is now based on multiple food types / dishes / ingredients and their input quantity level (compared to the previous (simplistic) food regime selection mode)

### UPDATE 7 - DECEMBER 10, 2024
- Individual page revamped: the waste management section is now redesigned by adding more complex data processing for disposal methods (incineration, landfill, recycling, etc).
- One brainstorming session held, focusing on user experience and efficiency improvements.
- Core development at 90-95% completion, with minor tweaks needed for data synchronization across modules.
- Upcoming Milestone: Full system test preparation for January 15, 2025 and Diet updates.

### UPDATE 6 - DECEMBER 3, 2024
- A major brainstorming session was held on November 25, accompanied by three mini-sessions for testing and syncing data with new features.
- The general design and layout for the main menu are 70% complete. UI development is almost finished for standard cases, with about 50-75% progress on exceptional cases (e.g., diet types levels, fuel types, extra transportation options - scooters, bicycle).
- The core functionality for carbon footprint calculation is nearly complete. Around 75% of code elements have been developed, with data synchronization at 70%. Testing is 80% complete, covering both main and exceptional cases.
- Recent focus was on handling special cases for fuel, housing consumption, vehicle types, and dietary diversification.
- General cases have been 90% tested, while 60% of exceptional cases have been covered. Full testing is dependent on resolving some minor bugs, which might delay further development by 2-3 days.

### UPDATE 5 - NOVEMBER 22, 2024
- The design of the main menu is complete (100%), with progress made on the overall interface (50% completed).
- General layout for selecting parameters is functional, but minor improvements are pending (background image, layout adjustments, menu selection improvements).
- Approximately 50% of overall testing is complete, with partial coverage of both general and exceptional cases. More intensive testing of exceptional cases is scheduled for November 22-24.
- Upcoming Milestones: Final code development and synchronization, including exceptional cases, to be completed by November 22-25, followed by final testing on November 25, 2024.

### UPDATE 4 - NOVEMBER 15, 2024
- The carbon footprint calculation feature is approximately 90% developed, with 50% of the code elements and synchronization of data complete.
- Partial testing of core functionalities has been performed, covering 90-100% of the main cases and around 5-10% of exceptional cases.
- Exceptional Cases: Minor delays have been noted in the implementation and testing of exceptional cases for the carbon footprint calculation.
- Optimizing synchronization between data and UI elements has been identified as a potential challenge, with anticipated completion after the final round of coding (and some adjustments of the roadmap).
- The third major brainstorming session took place, alongside five mini-meetings, which ensured project alignment and discussions on exceptional cases.

### UPDATE 3 - NOVEMBER 10, 2024
- Initial development for carbon footprint calculation functionality is 50% complete. Coding elements are partially implemented (20%), and data synchronization will follow final code development.
Issues Encountered:
- Carbon Footprint Calculations: There may be minor delays in handling special cases (e.g., carbon emissions based on housing types or transport type / fuel consumption calculations). These will be addressed in upcoming sessions.
- Upcoming Milestones: Further refinement of the calculation algorithms and code synchronization will be the focus, with the next development and demo testing scheduled by November 12, 2024.
- Second brainstorming session held (related to coding and the implementation overall)

### UPDATE 2 - NOVEMBER 7, 2024
- Submitted the first bi-weekly project development report.
- Completed the first stage of design development (layout of the main menu and related functionalities) (1/3 - Design), using Canva (for layout design) and Qt frameworks for widgets, classes and design functionalities - currently in development.
- Currently working on setting up parameters for carbon footprint calculations and implementing object/class structures (0.5/3 - Functionalities).
- No performance optimization has been done yet (as coding is still incomplete) (0/3 - Efficiency & Performance)
- Upcoming Milestones: Second major brainstorming session for core development is coming soon.

### UPDATE 1 - NOVEMBER 1, 2024
- GitHub repository created.
- First brainstorming session held.
- Each member now has a specific role in the project:
  * Radu-Andrei Cîrcioroabă: Data processing and calculation collaborator (responsible for developing mathematical models to estimate the carbon footprint efficiently, based on three categories: individual carbon footprint, diet/eating habits, and housing/residence) & layout designer.
  * Andrei-Valentin Bălălău & Ionuț-Cristian Pleșeanu: Graphic User Interface contributors (responsible for implementing graphic elements, using designs from our layout designer and features like adaptive video resolution, responsive design, and functional buttons) & integration developers (connecting visual elements with backend functionalities).
  * Ștefăniță Lican & Eduard Șipanu: Core developers, monitoring overall performance and implementing core features in C++ (main functionalities of a simplified carbon measurement app, including object-oriented operations with classes and various linking methods).
- The entire app will be developed in C++ (covering both design and coding functionalities).
